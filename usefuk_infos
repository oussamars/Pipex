fd[0] is for the read
fd[1] is for the write
access() checks whether the program can access the file pathname. 
in the begining work with execvp because its easyer and after you will work with the one they provided
start with this command : < file1 cat | wc > file2


Steps : 
Open file1 for reading.
Redirect file1 to stdin (use dup2).
Execute cmd1 using execve.
Once that works, add the second command:
Create a pipe.
Fork a child process.
Child executes cmd1, and its output goes into the pipe.
Parent reads from the pipe and executes cmd2.
🛠️ Step 3: Get the Smallest Working Version
Write a minimal main.c like this:

Open file1.
Create a pipe.
Fork a child.
In the child:
Redirect file1 to stdin with dup2().
Redirect pipe[1] to stdout with dup2().
Execute cmd1 with execve().
In the parent:
Close the unused ends of the pipe.
Fork again.
Redirect pipe[0] to stdin.
Redirect file2 to stdout.
Execute cmd2.
🛠️ Step 5: Lookup Paths for Commands
Instead of hardcoding /bin/cat or /usr/bin/wc, you need to:

Get the PATH environment variable.
Search for the right path for cmd1 and cmd2.
🛠️ Step 6: Once it Works – Handle Errors & Cleanup
Check every open(), pipe(), fork(), execve() return value.
Free memory if you allocate it.
Close all file descriptors.
🏁 Final Thought:
✔️ Small Steps to Follow:
First, open a file and execute cat < file1.
Second, create a pipe and execute cat < file1 | wc -l.
Third, parse paths for commands using PATH env.
Finally, handle errors and edge cases.
